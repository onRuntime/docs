## Getting Started

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The package isn't ready yet for React.JS, it is only available on Next.JS
</Callout>

Learn the basics of working with Kitchen UI components.

First you have to import the `KitchenProvider` component and wrap your application with it.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { KitchenProvider } from "@tonightpass/kitchen";

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <KitchenProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </KitchenProvider>
  );
};
```

  <summary>If you are on **Next.JS**, then you need to set up some additional things:</summary>
  First, you will need to go to your `next.config.js` file and add the following:

  ```js
  // next.config.js
  const { withKitchen } = require("@tonightpass/kitchen");

  module.exports = withKitchen({ ...customConfig });
  ```

  Then you will need to go to your `_document.tsx` file and import the `KitchenDocument`, then extend your Document class with it.

  ```tsx
  // _document.tsx
  import Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";
  import { KitchenDocument } from "@tonightpass/kitchen";

  export default class MyDocument extends KitchenDocument {
    render() {
      return (
        <Html lang="en">
          <Head />
          <body>
            <Main />
            <NextScript />
          </body>
        </Html>
      );
    }
  }
  ```

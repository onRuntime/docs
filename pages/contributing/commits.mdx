# Commits

Many companies don't pay attention to conventional commits, we do, because we like to have a clean project history and workflows to read. Most of us use [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph), an extension that allows us to read our Git history as a graph.
Our commits convention is inspired by [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) but customized into something more fun! 😄

## Structure

The commit message should be structured as follows and __in lowercase__:

```
<gitmoji> <type> <description> [(#<issue number>)]

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Example:

```bash
📝 update documentation contributors

- Add @jerembdn as a contributor
- Add @younesbessa as a contributor

Co-authored-by: Younes Bessa <younes@onruntime.com>
```

But most of the time we avoid wasting a lot of time on it so it looks more like this:

```bash
📝 update documentation contributors
```

## Gitmojis

We use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev) to categorize our commits, it has a good ecosystem and is very easy to use on a daily basis using [these tools](https://gitmoji.dev/related-tools).

Otherwise here is the complete list of these emojis, their code and the description given to them:
<Emojis />

## Types

We use the following commit types:

| Type        | Description            |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `add`       | Add a new feature      |
| `fix`       | Fix a bug              |
| `improve`   | Improve something      |
| `update`    | Update something       |
| `remove`    | Remove something       |
| `refactor`  | Refactor something     |
| `rename`    | Rename something       |
| `move`      | Move a file or folder  |
| `upgrade`   | Upgrade dependencies   |
| `downgrade` | Downgrade dependencies |

## Description

The description should be a short description of the commit, it should be written in the imperative, present tense. For example:

```bash
# Good
📝 update documentation contributors

# Bad
📝 updated documentation contributors
```

## Issue number

If the commit is related to an issue, you can add the issue number at the end of the description, for example:

```
📝 update documentation contributors (#123)
```

## Body

The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior. It should be written in the imperative, present tense. For example:

```bash
# Good
📝 update documentation contributors

- Add @jerembdn as a contributor
- Add @younesbessa as a contributor

Co-authored-by: Younes Bessa <younes@onruntime.com>

# Bad
📝 update documentation contributors

- Added @jerembdn as a contributor
- Added @younesbessa as a contributor

Co-authored-by: Younes Bessa <younes@onruntime.com>
```

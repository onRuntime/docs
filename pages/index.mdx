# onRuntime Studio

**onRuntime** is a studio that brings together teams of creators.

We are very interested in new technologies and the world of creation (design, music, etc.) in general, so we created a Studio and a community around that studio.

We are always working on new, exciting open source projects. If you'd like to contact us, feel free to join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/3qj6qF9) !

And if you're a developer and you'd like to contribute to any of [our open source projects](https://github.com/orgs/onRuntime/repositories), please check out our [Contributing Guidelines](/contributing/introduction).
